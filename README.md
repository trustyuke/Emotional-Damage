Overview:

Peg Solitaire is a single-player game played on a board with holes in it. The board is typically a grid with 7 rows and 7 columns, for a total of 49 holes. The game starts with a board that is mostly empty, except for a few pegs placed in specific holes. The player's goal is to jump pegs over one another, removing the peg that was jumped, until only one peg remains on the board. To play the game, the player selects a peg that is adjacent to an empty hole and jumps it over another peg into the empty hole. This removes the peg that was jumped from the board. The player can only jump pegs horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. The player continues to make jumps until no more moves are possible, at which point the game ends.
